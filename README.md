## Package Managers <a name="package-managers"></a>
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/): `pnpm` is a fast, efficient, and deterministic package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. Like `npm` and `yarn`, it manages dependencies for JavaScript projects. However, `pnpm` has some unique features and differences compared to these managers:

1. **Efficient Disk Usage with Symlinks**: The most notable feature of `pnpm` is its use of a content-addressable filesystem to store all of your project's dependencies in a single location. When installing packages, instead of copying them into the `node_modules` folder of your project, `pnpm` uses symlinks to reference them. This results in less disk space usage when multiple projects share the same dependencies.

2. **Strict Dependency Resolution**: Unlike `npm` and `yarn`, `pnpm` won't flatten dependencies by default. This ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated from each other, reducing the risk of accidentally using a package that wasn't explicitly specified in your project's `package.json`.

3. **Performance**: `pnpm` often boasts faster install times compared to `npm` and `yarn`, especially in scenarios where there are many shared dependencies across projects.

4. **Workspace Support**: Like `yarn` workspaces, `pnpm` supports a multi-project workspace setup, which is useful for managing monorepos.

5. **Deterministic**: Just like `yarn`, `pnpm` uses a lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) to ensure that every install results in the exact same node_modules structure across all environments.

6. **Compatibility**: For the most part, `pnpm` is compatible with the npm ecosystem. However, because of its strict approach to dependency management, some edge cases or assumptions made by certain packages might cause issues. 

7. **Overrides and Hooks**: `pnpm` provides a way to override fields in a package's `package.json` or apply hooks at various stages of the lifecycle.

Despite its benefits, `pnpm` isn't as widely adopted as `npm` or `yarn`. If you're considering using it, you should ensure that your projects and any tooling you rely on are compatible with `pnpm`. 

If you're looking for more efficient disk usage, stricter dependency resolution, and potentially faster installations, then `pnpm` might be worth a try.
